            This class is invoked by the GroupDocs.Product to license/watermak an Aspose.Product document instance.
            The calling must be done in a "secure" way so it is harder for hackers to find how GroupDocs uses Aspose without a license.
            To make the calling "secure" the class is internal so its name will be obfuscated, but it has a unique combination of default
            parameter values in its special constructor so GroupDocs can find it.
            This type has to be a struct, not a class. There is a situation where AppDomain sometimes cannot
            invoke internal members via reflection. We overcome this by creating default structure instances,
            it is somewhat a security hole in .NET.
